# Content TODOs

Every placeholder or missing fact on the site, and where to fill it in. Run
`npm run todos` to find `[TODO: ...]` markers left in the code.

Most of these can now be filled in through the content manager at `/admin` (see
`docs/ADMIN.md`); the CMS name is given in brackets, e.g. **[CMS: Site settings]**.

Empty values in `content/settings.json` are **hidden** on the site (never shown as
"TODO" to visitors), and empty optional product sections are hidden too, so they
are tracked here instead.

## `[TODO]` markers in files

These placeholders are in the files themselves. Those marked **visible** show on the
live site as written, so fill them in or remove the page before launch.

| File                                   | Placeholders                                                              | Visible? |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `content/case-studies/gari-becho.mdx`  | 3 result figures, 3 paragraphs (client details, rollout, results)         | **Yes**  |
| `content/products/crm-real-state.json` | 1 feature (title, description) [CMS: Products]                            | **Yes**  |
| `content/contact.ts`                   | Comment: confirm the budget ranges and currency in the contact form       | No       |
| `content/pages.ts`                     | Comment in `aboutPage`: add the founding year and how the company started | No       |

Run `npm run todos` to list them with line numbers.

The text needs the company's (ideally a lawyer's) approval, so it wasn't written for you. The footer links were removed because the pages don't exist; add `app/privacy` and `app/terms` and put the links back in `SiteFooter.tsx` when ready |

### Found on garibecho.com (not yet used, needs confirmation)

Gari Becho's contact section lists: email `beaconsoftld@gmail.com`, phone and WhatsApp
`+8801973249268`, address "Pallabi, Mirpur 12, Dhaka - 1216", support hours "24 hours".
The email there is spelled `beaconsoft**ld**`, not `beaconsoft**ltd**`; check which is correct.

| Gari Becho demo video  | `https://garibecho.com/videos/gari-becho-demo.mp4`   | Played from garibecho.com, loaded only on click. At ~0:26 it shows an unfinished box: "Screenshot: Balance after payment". Fix in the source video.  |
| Gari Becho screenshots | `public/images/products/gari-becho/*.webp`           | Frames from the demo video (cursor visible in some). Replace with direct app screenshots for sharper images.                                         |
| Brand originals        | `brand/`                                             | Avatar and social covers you supplied. The site logo (`components/shared/LighthouseMark.tsx`) and icons are redrawn from the avatar.                 |
| Blog cover             | `public/images/blog/custom-or-ready-made/cover.webp` | Generated brand illustration (lighthouse at night). Replace with a post-specific image if you like.                                                  |
| Product OG images      | `public/og/products/<slug>.png`                      | Generated from the product name, category and screenshot. A product added in the CMS uses `public/og/default.png` until a developer makes its image. |

## Before launch: contact form setup

The form does not work until these are set (see `.dev.vars.example` and `.env.example`):

1. **Turnstile:** Cloudflare dashboard → Turnstile → add a widget for the production domain.
   Set the site key as build variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` (Pages → Settings →
   Variables, "build" environment; it is baked into the page at build time) and the secret
   as `TURNSTILE_SECRET`. Without the site key, the form shows "The form can't send
   messages right now".
2. **Resend:** create an API key → `RESEND_API_KEY` (secret). Verify your domain in Resend
   and set `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` (e.g. `Beacon Soft website <website@yourdomain>`); until
   then emails come from `onboarding@resend.dev`, which only delivers to the Resend
   account owner.
3. **Recipient:** `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` (secret; comma-separate several addresses).
4. Send a test message from the live site after deploying.

## Before launch: content manager (/admin) setup

The content manager can't log in until these are done (details in `docs/ADMIN.md`,
"One-time setup"):

1. **Domain:** confirm the production domain. It must be the same in
   `content/settings.json` (`site.url`) and `public/admin/config.yml` (`base_url`,
   `site_url`, `display_url`); both currently say `https://beaconsoft.com.bd`. The build
   fails if they differ.
2. **GitHub OAuth app** under the Beacon-Soft-Ltd organization, callback URL
   `https://<domain>/api/callback`.
3. **Cloudflare variables:** `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` (text) and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
   (secret), Production environment; then redeploy.
4. **Editors:** give each editor Write access to `Beacon-Soft-Ltd/beacon-softltd-website`.
5. **Preview link:** check that "View Preview" appears in the editor for a draft. It
   relies on `preview_context: Cloudflare Pages` matching Cloudflare's GitHub status
   name; if it doesn't appear, adjust `preview_context` or use the link in Cloudflare's
   pull request comment.
6. Log in at `/admin/`, make a small test change, publish it and check the live site.

## SEO after launch

1. **Search Console:** verify the domain in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster
   Tools, then submit `https://<domain>/sitemap.xml`.
2. **Organization details:** the Organization JSON-LD on every page shows only what
   Site settings holds. Fill in email, phone, address and social links so search
   engines get them too.
3. **Product rich results:** Google shows software rich results only with a price
   (`offers`) or ratings. None are listed, because we have no confirmed prices or
   reviews. Add them only if real.
4. **Gari Becho meta description:** the English summary (`content/products/gari-becho.json`)
   is 174 characters, so Google will cut it off at about 155. Shorten it if you like.
5. **New products:** ask a developer to make the product's share image
   (`public/og/products/<slug>.png`, 1200 × 630).
6. **Check social previews:** paste a few page links into the Facebook Sharing Debugger
   and LinkedIn Post Inspector after launch.

## Security headers and performance (`public/_headers`)

1. **Adding something external** (a video host, analytics, a chat widget): its origin
   must be added to the Content-Security-Policy in `public/_headers`, or the browser
   blocks it. Allowed now: Turnstile (`challenges.cloudflare.com`), the Google Maps
   embed (`www.google.com`) and the Gari Becho demo video (`garibecho.com`).
2. **Known CSP limits:** `script-src` allows `'unsafe-inline'` because Next.js static
   export writes page data and the theme script inline (no per-request nonce is
   possible without a server). `/admin/*` allows `'unsafe-eval'` because Decap CMS
   doesn't load without it (tested). Both are documented in the file.
3. **HSTS preload:** `Strict-Transport-Security` is one year without `preload`. Add
   `includeSubDomains; preload` only once every subdomain of beaconsoft.com.bd serves
   HTTPS.
4. **Lighthouse:** all tested pages score 90+ on mobile and 100 on desktop. Re-check on the live site
   with PageSpeed Insights, which uses Cloudflare's real network.
